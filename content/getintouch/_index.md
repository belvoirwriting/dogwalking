I am an independent dog walker in the Vale Of Belvoir. I also offer day care, over night stays and pop in visits, tailored to meet your dog's individual needs.

I have a dog of my own called Ernie. He is a friendly and lively red cocker spaniel who loves to socialise with other dogs and is a much loved member of the family!
